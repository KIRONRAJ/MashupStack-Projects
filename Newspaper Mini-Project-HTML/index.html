        NEW DELHI, 27 December, 2021 - <b>T</b>he number of Omicron cases in
        India has risen to 578. Delhi reported 142 cases while 142 cases were
        detected in Maharashtra. They were followed by 57 cases in Kerala, 49 in
        Gujarat and 43 in Rajasthan. The total number of discharged Omicron
        patients stands at 151. Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh registered
        Omicron cases for the first time on Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
        With several states detecting cases of the Omicron variant and a surge
        in Covid-19 cases, night curfews have been imposed by governments in
        Delhi and Karnataka, among others, ahead of New Year's eve. The
        governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and
        Gujarat have enforced night curfews. Night curfew will be enforced in
        Delhi from Monday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, India activated its share of vaccine doses in the COVAX
        alliance to make more doses available as the country moves to include
        children and populations eligible for precautionary additional doses
        even as Omicron cases continue to surge. India could get about 20 crore
        doses from its share in COVAX. “This share will be procured from COVAX
        alliance in a graded manner. India has been providing free vaccine doses
        to low middle-income countries since the beginning of the pandemic,” a
        top health ministry official had earlier said. These would be doses of
        Covishield vaccine by Serum Institute of India (SII).

        The number of Omicron cases has risen to 578 in the country and at least
        151 have recovered, the health ministry said today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh on Sunday reported their
        first cases of the Omicron variant. Delhi- which also has reported the

        <u>Omicron: bleak new year or beginning of the end for the pandemic?</u>
      </h2>
      <div>
        <b
          >Scientists are cautiously optimistic that the variant may be a sign
          the virus is losing its power, despite the high infection figures
        </b>

      <q>
        Once again, Britain is experiencing a festive season hit by waves of
        Covid-19 infections. Last year, Christmas and the new year were spoiled
        by the appearance of the Alpha variant. This time, it is Omicron that
        has sent case numbers soaring. Christmas cancellations have swept
        through Britain's restaurants, pubs and clubs and left the country on
        the brink of another bleak New Year as the NHS warns once more that it
        is facing the threat of being overwhelmed by spiralling numbers of
        seriously ill patients.</q
      >
      <p>
        The scenario has raised fears that this now represents the shape of
        Christmases to come. Social restrictions and lockdown threats could
        become our normal festive fare.
      </p>
      <b>How close does this years's outbreak parallel that of last winter? </b>
      <p>
        At first glance, the two years look strikingly similar, with case
        numbers rocketing in only a few weeks in the UK. However,
        hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 remain very low so far this
        year, with latest research suggesting that the new variant appears to
        trigger fewer cases of severe illness than its viral predecessors.
        Scientists have generally treated these results studies as good news but
        have also counselled caution. Daily Covid-19 case numbers are still
        rising - they reached a record 122,000 on Friday - and it was estimated
        that 1.7 million people had Covid-19 in the UK last week.
      </p>
      <b
        >Are there noticeable differences in the ages of those affected by
        Omicron?
      </b>
      <p>
        Crucially, most of the new cases have occurred in young adults, which
        has led some researchers to warn that if Omicron starts to affect older
        – more vulnerable – people in greater numbers, hospitalisations could
        still jump. On the other hand, a huge number of people – especially the
        elderly – have now been give vaccines and boosters and will have gained
        considerable protection against Omicron. It remains to be seen how these
        different factors affect figures. At present, data is still being
        gathered and it is too early to be sure. At the same time, policy
        decisions to protect public health still have to be taken. The problem
        is highlighted by infectious disease epidemiologist Professor Mark
        Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. “There is inevitably a lag between
        infection and hospitalisation,” he told the journal Nature last week.
        “But in the meantime, policy decisions have to be made, and that is not
        straightforward.”
      </p>
      <b>Is the virus likely to lose its power to cause severe illness? </b>
      <p>
        Many scientists believe evidence is now suggesting that this idea may be
        correct. Recent studies in Scotland, England and South Africa all point
        in this direction. “My gut feeling is that this variant is the first
        step in a process by which the virus adapts to the human population to
        produce more benign symptoms,” says Dr Julian Tang, professor of
        Respiratory Sciences at Leicester University. “In a sense, it is to the
        virus’s advantage if it affects people in a way that that they don’t get
        too sick – because then they can walk around and mingle in society and
        spread the virus even more.”
      </p>
      <b>So will Covid-19 end up behaving like flu? </b>
      <p>
        Some health officials have predicted that Covid-19 could end up behaving
        like influenza, which requires a new vaccine to deal with new strains
        that appear every year. However, Professor Martin Hibberd, of the London
        School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues that coronaviruses –
        like those that already cause common colds – do not behave this way:
        “They do not appear as new strains every year. The reason we get colds
        in winter is because our immunity to coronaviruses does not last very
        long. And this virus seems to be more similar to those that cause common
        colds. In other words, we may still need to think about giving vaccines
        to protect against Covid-19 every year because immunity will always
        slip.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That does not mean we face “doom and gloom” for the next five years,
        adds Tang. “I think the virus will evolve itself out of the pandemic
        strain very soon and become milder, more transmissible to the point
        where you may only need to think about vaccinating the more vulnerable
        members of the population.”
